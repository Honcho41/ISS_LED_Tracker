# ISS_LED_Tracker
ISS tracker that will change the colours of a set of LEDs depending on whether the ISS is in view, in sunlight, or in eclipse

After building the LEGO International Space Station, somebody suggested I could buy the light kit for it.
I already had a 1M strip of neopixels so I decided to build my own kit.

I thought "wouldn't it be cool if it could somehow tie in to the real-time look of the ISS".
So using a RPi0 I decided to try and code something that would show orange for when the ISS is in daylight; blue for when it's in eclipse; and bright white for
when it's over my horizon.

V2.0 of the code works well but I'm happy to take advice to clean it up.
